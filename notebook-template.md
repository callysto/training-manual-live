# Below is a "Bare Bones" Template of How Your Notebooks Should be Formatted

## Introduction

**Motivate**  and introduce the content and context of your notebook. **Why** are you creating this notebook? **What** will you teach? **Why** should the reader care?

### Naming Conventions
Your notebook name should be kebab-case and it should not contain your Jira task identifier. 
If your notebook is in a directory, your directory should have the same name as your notebook but in UpperCamelCase. 
All files should have descriptive names.


### Banners

The markdown to display the banner in the header should be

`![Callysto.ca Banner](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-top.jpg?raw=true)`

and in the footer

`[![Callysto.ca License](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-bottom.jpg?raw=true)](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md)`

### Organization
If you have files accompanying your notebook they should be in a directory along with your notebook.
Images should all be in an `images` folder, with the exception of the [header](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-top.jpg?raw=true) and [footer](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-bottom.jpg?raw=true).


### Background

Include the background information about your content. Include examples and explanation to help guide your notebooks.

#### Examples

Use Python or your own explanations to provide **examples and interactivity** to help teach and showcase the concepts to the student.

#### Questions

Ask questions throughout your document to **keep the student engaged** and thinking about the content you've provided.

## Conclusion

Summarize your notebook. **Reiterate** the lesson and important takeaways.

##### Does your notebook contain all these items? If not be sure to add them.
