# Geogebra
[GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) is a powerful tool for creating interactive classroom materials and visualizations that many teachers are 
familiar with. 

## Why use Geogebra in Jupyter?
While GeoGebra allows a teacher to export their material to the GeoGebra website, the online interface makes it difficult 
to build a lesson around that material. The GeoGebra website will only display one applet at a time but a Jupyter notebook 
can display many. 
Jupyter is easier to use than the GeoGebra books. Jupyter also allows Geogebra to be embedded in a standard HTML web page 
without learning how to use their API or having a working knowledge of HTML. 

The Jupyter environment allows the teacher to build a lesson in a Jupyter notebook containing 
rich text and mathematical equations, interspersed with interactive GeoGebra applets. This notebook can then be distributed 
to students, who will be able to not only interact with the GeoGebra, applets: they will also be able to edit and add text. 
This will allow a teacher to include questions to be answered with the help of the applets, which can be answered by students 
within the notebook itself.

We're working on a Python library to try to make this process as easy and seamless as possible while also providing you with 
powerful tools.
