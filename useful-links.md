## Educational Resources
These resources are very important as the curriculum modules chosen for development are from the current K-12 Alberta curriculum. Although Alberta is currently undergoing a curriculum review, the modules selected for development are core learning concepts (e.g. functions in math) that will apply to future curriculums. If you want more information about the curriculum module you are developing, please visit the links below.

## Educational Resources for Children and Teachers
These resources were suggested to us by a group of K-12 teacher advisors. They contain information that is relevant to the development of Jupyter notebooks for the classroom.
